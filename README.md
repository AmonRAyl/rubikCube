# rubikCube
Currently, I've only implemented the fundamental logic of the Rubik's Cube in the "cube.cpp" file. The cube mixing process is not truly random at this point; it relies on values generated by the random library. 
To-do: Replace the random mixing with a more sophisticated method and display the cube using SDL graphics instead of basic ASCII characters in the console, as it is right now.
